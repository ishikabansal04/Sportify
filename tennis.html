            <p style="font-size:16px;">Tennis is a sport played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two 
                players each (doubles). Each player uses a strung racquet to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt 
                over a net into the opponent’s court. The modern game of tennis was born in the United Kingdom in the late 
                19th century. Then it was called “lawn tennis”. Tennis soon became popular among the upper- class English-speaking
                 population.
                Then it began to be played around the world. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of 
                society at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including people in 
                wheelchairs.
                
                Other than the fact that the tiebreaker was adopted in the 1970s, the rules of tennis have not changed 
                much since the 1890s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of “instant replay”
                technology coupled with a point challenge system. This allows a player to challenge the official call of
                a point.</p>

                                        As per ITF rules, Tennis balls are yellow colored spherical balls,
                                         with a diameter between 2.5 and 2.625 inches. They weigh between 2 and 21/16 oz. Pressurized rubber is used to make semi spherical half shells. 
                                        They are then joined with compressed air between them. </p>

                                            Just running shoes don’t provide enough lateral support to players. Tennis shoes are designed to give players
                                             better stability and prevent them from sliding while moving sideways. 
                                            Shoes shouldn’t damage the court when players move briskly across the court.
